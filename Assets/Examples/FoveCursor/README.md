 + If yes, places the cursor at the midpoint between the two hit locations
 + Otherwise, places the cursor at the midpoint of two points that are 3 units infront of the user

 + Check if the open eyes raycast has hit an object
 + If yes, places cursor at the hit location
 + Otherwise, places the cursor 3 units in front of the users open eye
